      <p>Man, I love logos. A little piece of imagery that represents the ideal you want your project to be â€” that's design magic right there. I've been able to work on some great logo projects, but I've been itching to do more. So I put myself to work. Rather than wait for projects to come my way, I gave myself a project of my own: <strong>design 50 logos.</strong> I tried pushing myself: exploring different styles, subjects, and techniques. It was like design boot camp: working all those muscles you never use. It wasn't pretty, but I'm proud of this work and these logos. Each one is a winner. Each one has something special. Each one is ready to be printed on t-shirts, fit inside an app icon, or shown off big-as-hell up on a billboard.</p>

      <p>This is where you come in. I've got 50 logos. You've got a place for one. You've got something you're working on that could use a logo. You might not have been in the market for a custom design job. But now you have 50 options to choose from. 50 professionally designed, production ready, high quality logos. All you need is one.</p>
